### Getting started with Farplane

When you first load the application, you will be prompted to select which game you wish to
load. At this time, Final Fantasy X support has not been implemented.

Once you have made your selection, you will need to choose a process/game to attach to. Farplane
will attempt to show only appropriate processes, but if yours doesn't appear, right click the
process list and select *Show all processes*.
