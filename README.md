## Farplane
Farplane is a memory editing tool for Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. As the project is still in development (and likely will
be for quite some time) you may encounter bugs or crashes. Although Farplane doesn't edit any files, always keep a backup of your saved data, and it is recommended that you use a different save slot where possible.

### Ability/creature names are in German! Help!

[The ability and creature name lists are based on this data from the German version of the game](http://www.ultimate-cheatz.de/codebase/daten.php?system=ps2&act=spiel&id=915)

Since there are a large number of ability and creature names, the data used in the app has been copied directly and it is currently only partially translated. If you like the app and want to help translate the creature or command name lists, it's really easy and your help would be greatly appreciated!

You can download the list files here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topher-au/Farplane/master/FFX2/Values/Commands.cs
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topher-au/Farplane/master/FFX2/Values/Creatures.cs

Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad, and change any of the names in the list discover while using the app.
Send the partially translated files to lordramza@gmail.com, or contact me via private message. *Any submitters will get an in-app credit!*
