# Farplane
A memory editing suite for Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster

## Getting started

Open the application and select the game to attach to. If the game process is not showing up in the
list, right-click the list and select *Show all processes*

## Help translating ability and creature names
The only complete list I could find of creature and ability IDs is in German. I have already entered
some of the English names, but there are a lot and I need help. If you can help, download the following
two files, open them in Notepad and change the names to the English version when you find out what it
is.
