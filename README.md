### Translating ability names

[The ability and creature name lists are based on this data from the German version of the game](http://www.ultimate-cheatz.de/codebase/daten.php?system=ps2&act=spiel&id=915)

If you like the app and can help translate the creature or command name lists, it's really easy and your help would be greatly appreciated!

You can download the list files here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topher-au/Farplane/master/FFX2/Values/Commands.cs

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topher-au/Farplane/master/FFX2/Values/Creatures.cs

Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad, and change any of the names in the list discover while using the app.
Send the partially translated files to lordramza@gmail.com, or contact me via private message. *Any submitters will get an in-app credit!*
